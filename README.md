# The Advanced Android Camera
We all know that camera quality is important when choosing and using a phone - 71% of people said so [https://viewpoints.xyz/polls/small-phones](in this poll). The sensor and SoC/ISP hardware is only part of the story. Incumbent manufacturers maintain their own highly advanced camera apps - this acts as a moat, making it harder for smaller companies to compete on the smartphone market, because they have to build an amazing camera app from scratch.

The lack of advanced open-source camera apps limits competition in the smartphone market, and makes it harder for new smartphone manufacturers to start up. **Commercial licenses** are available to manufacturers which can include customisations and hardware-integrations.

If we, the small-phone (and wider) community, are able to build a great open-source camera app, it’ll open up the smartphone industry as a whole, and make niche phones more viable.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Android Development environment: Many people use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). More experienced and/or CLI developers will find ways that work for their operating system release and needs.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ThePhoneProject/advanced-android-camera.git
   cd advanced-android-camera
   ```
2. Build and install a debug release
   Connect an Android phone with developer mode enabled or configure an Android Virtual Device (AVD)
   ```sh
   gradlew installDebug
   ```
3. Start the camera app on the device
<!-- TODO add command line example to launch the default activity -->
